This program is a simple Amazon Echo skill that responds with a random
oblique programming strategy.

The oblique strategies are from Rob Blackwell and used with his permission.

The code is a lightly modified version of the Amazon Alexa Skills
demo program "Space Geek"

The original Readme.txt from Amazon explains how to set up an Alexa Skill 
as a developer on your own Amazon Echo.  If you are a developer, I hope
there is enough here for you to get it up and running for your own personal
use.  I don't see the Alexa Skill as having a broad enough appeal to polish
it up and go through the Amazon publshing process.

The simplest interaction is

 User: "Alexa, ask Eno"

 Alexa: (reads back an oblique strategy from programming)
